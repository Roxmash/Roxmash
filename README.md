### **Hyper Pong**  

Our firts group project was to develop a Pong game with our own touch, 2 gamemodes and a local saveprogress was the demands. this is the final form of our doing. all graphic assets was made by me and the music and soundeffects by Andreas Jonasson. our third member was our senpai Luca salmi thatprimary focused on the code itself.
my prio in this work was the engine behaviour, the UI/UX design and as i mentioned, the graphics. Give it a try and enjoy our epic game! ps. we added ingame currency ;)

### **Trivia Quiz** 

A colorful trivia app that I worked on together with a couple of classmates for our Swift course. It's a lightweight trivia app that uses the triviadb API to fetch and display questions with answers. We also implemented coredata to save and display highscore as well as functionality to revisit an old Quiz to see 
what you got right / wrong during your playthrough!

### **NotePad v2.0**

A lightweight (and slightly bland) notepad app I've made for my Java course at KYH! The UI so far is quite basic but it has all the necessary functionality 
with a save/load function as well as a delete function to boot. Something I'm looking to work further on a rainy day. ðŸ˜Ž

### **SwiftUI WeatherApp**

A vibrant and colorful weather application made with SwiftUI. Has a simple gradient colorscheme with a toggle button for day/night mode. Will have to work 
further on it to implement a proper API so it can finally be put to use! â˜”
